This version of the Node Catapult boilerplate utilizes the Angular version (https://github.com/dyale/node-catapult-angular) of mindeavor's original (https://github.com/mindeavor/node-catapult) and implements mindeavor's Node endpoint for compiling Sass (https://github.com/mindeavor/node-sass-endpoint)
